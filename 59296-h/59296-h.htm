<p class='c005'>If we consider the present awakening in pharmacy, it may seem
to some that we are making very rapid strides, but as a matter of
fact the progress of pharmaceutical education in this country
has been comparatively slow. The history of pharmacy in this
country may be divided into three periods: (1) The pioneer period
during the sixteenth century, when there were no physicians, and
the general storekeeper who sold dry goods, groceries, books and
paints, also sold medicines and prescribed them; (2) the colonial
period during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when educated
physicians from abroad emigrated to the colonies and prescribed
as well as dispensed medicines; (3) the college period, or the period
of organization and development, during the nineteenth century,
when pharmacy became a distinct profession and business, and colleges
of pharmacy were established, these numbering nearly 100 at
the present time. We are now entering, after nearly a century,
upon the fourth period, namely, that of standards in education, and
we are endeavoring to fix the position of pharmacy among the other
professions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The problem of pharmaceutical education involves two phases,
namely (1) that of the natural ability and preliminary qualifications
of the applicants for entrance to the colleges and schools of pharmacy,
and (2) that of the character and kind of instruction that
shall be given by a recognized teaching institution in pharmacy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Not only are these two classes of standards being considered by the
teaching bodies themselves, but also by the boards of pharmacy,
and with the enactment of laws in various States it will now be
possible for more or less concerted action to be taken throughout the
United States.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>PRELIMINARY REQUIREMENTS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Our system of popular education is the boast of our country, and
well may it be, for it has been making steady advances during all
the years of our national existence. At the present time the
facilities for instruction and the opportunities for obtaining a good
general education are so ample that it seems hardly credible that
any one who is desirous of obtaining an education should fail
in the attempt.</p>

<p class='c006'>It follows logically that as the standard of general education is
advanced, the standards in colleges, technical schools and universities
will also be advanced, and thus we find to-day that the majority of
these institutions are not only constantly improving their curricula
but they are seeing to it that those who go to them for instruction are
qualified to pursue the prescribed line of studies. The only wonder
is that the entrance standards in some of the professional schools
have not been advanced more rapidly than they have, for in no
other way have they been more handicapped than in this.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is true there may be some parts of our country where the
opportunities for obtaining an education are more or less limited,
but this is no argument why those in the vanguard should stop in
their course and wait for the center of population to shift a few
hundred miles. We know that in Alaska and the Philippines the
means for education are not so ample as they are with us, but we
are not thinking of stopping to wait for those countries. On the
contrary they desire us to go ahead and they will follow as rapidly
as possible. And so if the youths of the country districts of Iowa,
or Kansas, or Missouri have not, as is claimed by some, the opportunity
for obtaining a high school education, is that any reason why
those in Ohio, or Michigan, or Pennsylvania should be excused for
neglecting theirs? No, this is not the way of progress.</p>

<p class='c006'>If there are any two professions or callings where the unfit should
be culled out more than in others, it is in those of medicine and
pharmacy. These are the professions calling for the highest type of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>manhood, and at the same time special educational equipment and
intellectual acumen. Being largely answerable to himself in the
conduct of his business, it is plain that the pharmacist must be of a
high moral type, and if he is of the type that he should be to
assume such a responsible calling, he will first see to it that his general
education warrants him in undertaking its pursuit. But if there
are those who have not the moral sense to conscientiously qualify
themselves by obtaining the necessary preliminary education, then
the teaching bodies should exercise their power to eliminate them.
Here is where the highest obligation of the schools and colleges of
pharmacy rests, and here is where the supreme test of their sense of
their obligation to the public comes in.</p>

<p class='c006'>Certainly those applicants for entrance who have had opportunities
for obtaining an education and have been so indifferent as not
to improve them, can hardly be considered fit candidates for the
practice of pharmacy. Entrance to a college presupposes a good
general education; the studies to be mastered require it, and to
admit the unqualified reacts on all those engaged in the practice of
pharmacy and in the teaching of pharmacy. It also does harm to
those who are still in the public schools, for instead of finishing their
courses they discontinue their studies knowing that they can fit
themselves by short cuts. It lowers the standard of the schools of
pharmacy and so tends to keep away those who are qualified to
pursue the work. In short, it lowers the tone of pharmacy at every
point. And who can say that it does not eventually make an impression
on the general public and influence them in withholding
their support, both moral and financial?</p>

<p class='c006'>I know of a young man who desired to study law, but who had
not gone further than the grammar school. When he came to
inquire about the terms of admission to the bar, he found that
graduation from a high school was required. He then decided to
enter school again and go through the high school. Can any one
doubt the advantage of such a course to this young man or to the
profession of law in requiring him to complete his preliminary
education?</p>

<p class='c006'>There are those who incline to take pity on those applicants in
pharmacy who have not the desired amount of preliminary education
and who argue that they should be given a chance. But this
is a false kind of charity; if the applicants are sincere and have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>natural ability, they should be advised to go back to school, but if
they belong to the shiftless class, they should above all things not be
allowed to ally themselves with pharmacy. No, this is not the place
for the exercise of charity, particularly when we think of our obligations
to the great public who have so long and so implicitly
trusted us.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>COLLEGE COURSES.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Having once eliminated the unfit, the next highest duty of the
colleges of pharmacy is to qualify their students for the work that
they may be called upon to do. This may seem like a very trite
saying to some of you, and yet I feel warranted in its utterance.
We have reached a crisis in pharmaceutical history, and if the pharmacist
is to continue a separate and independent existence it must
be on the basis of his scientific attainments. The pharmacist has
felt his hampered position for some time, but now that the Pure
Food and Drugs Act has become effective, we are face to face with
the issue. With the United States Pharmacopœia and the National
Formulary as the legal standards he will now be held responsible
for the identity and quality of the drugs which he sells. The question
then is, will he assume this responsibility, and pronounce finally
on the quality and efficiency of the drugs and medicines which he
dispenses, or will he shift this responsibility whenever possible? If
he adopts the latter course, then will he lose in importance and
standing to that extent.</p>

<p class='c006'>By the adoption of the Pure Food and Drugs Act both the
responsibility and the obligation of the pharmacist are increased and
added importance must attach to his position. He should take as
much pride in his ability to pronounce upon the quality of an article
guaranteed by the manufacturer, or in making a preparation which
he himself guarantees, as he has heretofore taken in his ability to
decide upon the compatibility, or to question the dosage, of a prescription.
He must stand between the manufacturer and the physician
as he has stood between the physician and the public. Too
much care cannot be exercised in this direction, for the manufacturer’s
guarantee may in some instances prove to be only a label.</p>

<p class='c006'>To do work of this kind means that the pharmacist shall be a
master of the Pharmacopœia, that he shall be able to identify any
substance in the Pharmacopœia, carry out any of the tests, and make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>any of the preparations in the Pharmacopœia and National Formulary,
processes for which are given. The least, then, that the colleges
of pharmacy can do is to prepare their students to employ the
Pharmacopœia and the National Formulary as working guides.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>EXAMINATIONS BY BOARDS OF PHARMACY.</h3>

<p class='c008'>With the proper preliminary requirements established, and without
entering at this time into a discussion of the question as to the
number of hours required for the work that should be done, believing
as I do that the colleges and schools belonging to the Conference
of Teaching Faculties will be able to decide this problem, I may
say that no discussion of the educational problem is complete at this
time without reference to the nature of the examinations of the
Boards of Pharmacy. In years gone by these examinations have
been largely theoretical, and hence were not so valuable as they
might have been in testing the fitness of a candidate. Happily,
there is beginning to be an improvement in this direction and the
examinations are becoming more practical. To my way of thinking
the aim of the boards of pharmacy should be to determine
what a candidate can do. The theory has been given to him
in college, and the final test should be to determine whether he has
a working knowledge of the materials which he handles. Instead
of asking him what are the elementary forms of matter, or what is
a water-bath, or to give the family name of a plant yielding a drug,
it would be better to give him some drug or chemical to identify, to
carry out the tests for purity according to the Pharmacopœia and to
make a preparation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The boards of pharmacy have a very important work to perform
in determining the fitness of candidates and in determining whether
the colleges are faithfully carrying on their work. As matters are
now constituted they are the final arbiters and should be fully cognizant
of the great trust which they hold. It should no longer be
possible for the unqualified or incompetent to enter college, spend
two or three years at college and be given a degree and finally pass
a State Board as a registered pharmacist.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>THE DUTY OF PHARMACISTS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Pharmacists themselves also have a very important part to perform
in raising pharmacy to the plane that it must occupy to maintain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>its separate existence. In the first place they should not admit into
apprenticeship young men who are deficient in preliminary education,
for quite naturally they hope sooner or later to enter the
schools of pharmacy. Indeed to admit such as these into apprenticeship
is not only an injustice to them but also to the colleges of
pharmacy, and this may be considered as one of the fundamental
tests as to whether the pharmacist has the true interests of his calling
at heart. Pharmacists can at this point be of real service to
these young men by encouraging them and advising them to continue
their education in the public schools or to acquire it in some
other way.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second duty of the pharmacist is to endeavor to conduct his
business in such a manner that the educated young men will be
attracted to it (for undoubtedly there is no more interesting work
than that connected with the profession of pharmacy), and find
something to repay them for their pains, and to appeal to their
aspirations as professional men.</p>

<p class='c006'>The third duty of the pharmacist is to the physician. If the
physician is willing to rely upon the pharmacist and to help him in
maintaining and re-establishing the profession of pharmacy by
prescribing only the preparations and medicines in the Pharmacopœia
and National Formulary, and the new and non-official
remedies approved by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of
the American Medical Association, then should the pharmacist aim
to eliminate as rapidly as possible patent medicines, nostrums and
sundry articles not used as medicines, or as aids to the sick, or even
as toilet preparations, and prepare to give his undivided attention
to his profession, which alone by training, education and experience
he is qualified to conduct.</p>

<p class='c006'>In briefly summing up my remarks I may say that I have
endeavored to emphasize the essential principles which we must
bear in mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1) A good preliminary education is essential to an apprentice
and student of pharmacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2) The least that a college or school of pharmacy should do is
to send forth graduates that are masters of every detail of the U. S.
Pharmacopœia and the National Formulary.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3) It is the duty of the Board of Pharmacy to determine what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>applicants for the certificate of Registered Pharmacist can do rather
than what they are able to memorize.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4) That pharmacists themselves must share in the work of
elevating the standards of pharmacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we are clear on these principles, sincere in our professions and
earnest in our endeavors, the details can easily be worked out.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>THE FOOD AND DRUGS ACT IN ITS RELATION TO PUBLIC HEALTH.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='small'><span class='sc'>By Charles H. LaWall.</span></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The responsibility of the pharmacist in his attitude toward fraud
and quackery was never more important than it is at the present
time, and there should be no reluctance on the part of the members
of the profession to serve the public in the capacity of disseminators
of information concerning this important subject which is everywhere
under discussion, the Food and Drugs Act.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the United States the actual control of the quality of food and
drugs within any given State is a power of the State and not of the
federal authority, and owing to the previous absence of legislation
controlling interstate commerce the authorities within the individual
States (usually the Dairy and Food Commissioner) were confined to
the boundaries of these States in bringing prosecutions. In order
to control the sale of products made outside of the State and shipped
into it, the seller, often an innocent victim, had to be proceeded
against, and the manufacturer, the real offender, was secure from
any punishment as long as he remained without the State.</p>

<p class='c006'>This condition of affairs, of course, worked hardship upon persons
who were not morally responsible, who were made defendants
in criminal prosecutions and were compelled to resort to the civil
courts for redress, which was usually inadequate.</p>

<p class='c006'>On June 30, 1906, by the passage of the act known as the Food
and Drugs Act, which went into effect legally on January 1, 1907,
this condition of affairs was changed, and every article of interstate
commerce is now subject to the act, the rules and regulations of
which have occasioned much serious thought among the large class
of manufacturers of products which come within its scope.</p>

<p class='c006'>The underlying principles of the act, and the rules and regulations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>which have been drafted for its enforcement, are not obscure. They
are based upon common honesty. That is, no hardship is worked
upon persons who sell their products for what they are, without any
misrepresentation. This at first glance would not seem to be a
harsh requirement, but when we go into the subject a little more
fully we are confronted with the fact that the present era of advertising
has developed a carelessness of statement to say nothing of
numerous instances of wilful misrepresentation suggesting that the
allegation of P. T. Barnum that the American people like to be
humbugged, was never more true than at the present time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Academic questions as to the harmfulness of certain preservatives
or colors, or substitutes for this or that well-known foodstuff, do not
enter into the question at all. The phrase “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caveat emptor</span>,” let the
buyer beware, is not applicable to foodstuffs, for the buyer as a rule
is not capable of judging as to the presence or absence of certain
constituents which may or may not be harmful according to the
idiosyncrasy of the consumer.</p>

<p class='c006'>For example, fifty or seventy-five years ago the commonly used
chemical preservatives, salicylic and benzoic acids and saccharin
were unknown and when they were resorted to by manufacturers of
foodstuffs it was done secretly and without notice to the consumer.
While the presence of a small amount of any one of these substances
might not occasion any disturbance in a normal individual there are
many instances in which even small amounts are absolutely contraindicated.
Under commercial conditions existing previous to the
passage of the act mentioned the buyer never could tell just what
was contained in a package, which might be marked absolutely pure
and be decorated with representations of dozens of medals and prize
awards, often based upon superficial judgment of the products so
honored.</p>

<p class='c006'>The misbranding clause is Section 8 of the law and reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>“That the term ‘misbranded’ as used herein shall apply to all
drugs or articles of food, or articles which enter into the composition
of food, the package or label of which shall bear any statement,
design or device regarding such article, or the ingredients or substances
contained therein, which shall be false or misleading in any
particular and to any food or drug product which is falsely branded
as to the State, territory or country in which it is manufactured or
produced.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Since the act has become effective the products of certain large
packing houses, which were formerly called potted ham or potted
tongue are now labeled “potted meat, ham-flavor” and “potted
meat, tongue-flavor.” The substance has not been changed. It is
simply designated by its right name and all the claims for purity
made by these firms in the past are now to be judged by the actions
of these same firms when under compulsion and in fear of the law.</p>

<p class='c006'>Several years ago a well-known Philadelphian became sponsor for
a brand of coffee which was advertised and sold under the caption
of “tannin-free coffee.” This purported to be coffee from which
the poisonous (?) tannic acid had been removed. Investigation
showed it to be coffee from which a chaff-like substance lying between
the segments of the bean had been removed by mechanical
means, and, as this chaff-like substance was found to contain less
tannic acid than the original coffee, and, as the statement as to the
tannic acid being poisonous was equally unwarranted, it was one of
the most reprehensible of the class of what would now be termed
misbranded substances.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a matter of fact the tannic acid in coffee is in such intimate
combination with the caffeine and other valuable constituents of
the bean that it would be absolutely impossible to remove it without
destroying the properties of the coffee so that it would be unrecognizable.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ultimate fate of this article, which perished along with several
associated ventures, did not prove a deterrent to another and still
more glaring fraud of a similar character which has been advertised
during the past year, <i>i. e.</i> a brand of coffee called  “Digesto Coffee”
which claims to be as harmless as the well-known cereal substitutes
for this agreeable beverage by virtue of the fact that the poisonous
(?) caffeine and poisonous (?) tannic acid have both been removed.
I need scarcely say that such claims are without the slightest foundation
in fact, and an analysis recently made by me of the contents
of a package of the article showed a slightly higher percentage of
caffeine than the average in coffee, and no perceptible diminution
in the amount of tannic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>I refer to both of these instances specifically, as under all previous
laws it was impossible to proceed against either of these firms,
while under the new law they are both amenable to the section on
misbranding.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>As regards the subject of drugs, the work of Samuel Hopkins
Adams in <cite>Collier’s Magazine</cite>, together with the assistance of Mr.
Bok in the <cite>Ladies’ Home Journal</cite>, is too well-known to require repetition,
and yet I fear that the force of these arguments is lost upon
many persons who look upon them as the fulminations of yellow
journalism. Nothing could be further from the truth. The half
has never been told and the real truth will probably never be known
by the public concerning the numerous changes which have been
made in many well-known preparations which must now declare
the presence of certain constituents which are enumerated in the
body of the law. Among the better known of these substances
may be mentioned alcohol, morphine, opium, cocaine, chloroform,
chloral hydrate, cannabis indica and acetanilide.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many proprietors of nostrums which have been entirely dependent
upon their alcoholic strength for their medicinal and remedial effect,
have changed the formulas so as to be less liable to criticism, still
retaining enough of the original features, however, to make them
objectionable to those who see through the subterfuge.</p>

<p class='c006'>The number of persons in the community who are really able to
judge such preparations is wofully small and it will require a constant
campaign of education for many years to bring the every-day
consumer of preparations of this class to a sense of his personal
responsibility in such matters.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even the medical profession has suffered by this gigantic bunco
game.</p>

<p class='c006'>Antikamnia, a proprietary preparation which was advertised for
years under the claim that it was a definite synthetic compound, in
spite of the fact that every one who knew anything about organic
chemistry knew better, has at last been publicly unmasked as a mixture
of acetanilide, caffeine and sodium bicarbonate; and in refuge
from the necessity of declaring the amount of acetanilide upon the
label, the firm which makes it has changed the formula so as to
substitute phenacetine for acetanilide, and yet the same unwarranted
and extravagant claims are made for the preparation that
were made before, with no notice to the medical profession that a
radical change has been made in its composition, and entirely ignoring
the stultification of the former claims as a definite uniform
chemical compound.</p>

<p class='c006'>Other instances might be cited, but enough has been said, I think,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>to show you that the effect of the law is being felt by those who
have made themselves amenable to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>One important feature must be remembered. It is this: On
every package of foodstuff or drug put up under the new law, the
words “Guaranteed under the U. S. Food and Drugs Act, June 30,
1906, Serial No. ——” appears. This is being used in such a way
as to make it appear that the Government in some unknown way
stands sponsor for the quality of the substance, when in truth it is
but a compliance with that part of the Act, Sec. 9, which says:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“No dealer shall be prosecuted under the provisions of this act
when he can establish a guarantee signed by the wholesaler, jobber,
manufacturer, or other party residing in the United States, from
whom he purchases such article, to the effect that the same is not
adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of this act designating
it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus it will be seen that the guaranty means nothing more than
the word of the manufacturer that he will be responsible in case of
prosecution, and I fear that not a few of the guarantees at present
published are given without due regard to facts, in the hope that the
Department of Agriculture, with the tremendous task confronting
it of putting the rules and regulations into practice, may be a long
while reaching some of these articles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile many persons will be deluded into purchasing such
articles in the belief that the phrase referred to is evidence that the
Government is responsible for the claims made, when in point of fact
nothing of the kind is meant.</p>

<p class='c006'>An instance recently coming to my attention, presumably of this
kind, is that of an article which is being advertised in the prominent
daily newspapers in the form of reading notices (a most reprehensible
form of advertising) as a remedy for consumption and bronchial
affections. An examination of the substance shows it to be a
fictitious product containing oil of turpentine, gum turpentine, with
evident traces of copaiba and sandalwood. It bears a label which
indicates a somewhat mixed origin, as two widely differing plants of
the pine family are included in the botanical name which is given
for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the regulation of the narcotic drugs, such as opium and its
derivatives, morphine, cocaine, etc., a wonderful step has been taken.
If the public could realize the harm that has been done to persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>who have unconsciously formed drug habits by taking proprietary
catarrh cures there would be universal amazement at the depths of
degradation to which a manufacturer will lower himself in order
to increase the profit on an article by stimulating an increase in its
sale. Instances have come before the authorities at Washington in
which manufacturers have frankly admitted that they had added
morphine or cocaine to their nostrums in order that their continued
use might be assured.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is much work still to be done in the near future in connection
with the enforcement of the act to render its provisions effective,
but I believe that I have given enough examples from the
hundreds which I have at my disposal to indicate that the ultimate
effect of the Food and Drugs Act, if it be wisely enforced, as is
expected, will be very material in benefiting the health of the community
at large.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>PROPRIETARY PREPARATIONS APPROVED BY COUNCIL ON PHARMACY AND CHEMISTRY.</h2>
</div>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>ARISTOCHIN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Aristochin.—CO (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>25</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>=C<sub>41</sub>H<sub>46</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, the neutral carbonic
ester of quinine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—The same as those of quinine, but, since it is
only slowly acted on by acids, it is said not to produce disturbance
of the stomach and to be notably free from tendency to production
of cinchonism. Dosage.—The same as that of quinine, in powder,
mixed with milk sugar, dry on the tongue or suspended in
liquids. Manufactured by Farbenfabriken, vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp;
Co., Elberfeld, Germany (Continental Color &amp; Chemical Co., New
York).</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>ARISTOL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A name applied to Thymolis iodidum, U. S. P. Manufactured by
Farbenfabriken, vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co., Elberfeld, Germany (Continental
Color &amp; Chemical Co., New York).</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>ASPIRIN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Aspirin C<sub>6</sub>H·<sub>4</sub>O(CH<sub>3</sub>CO)·COOH· 1:2 = C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the acetyl derivative
of salicylic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Actions and Uses.—It acts like salicylic acid, over which it possesses
the advantage of producing less of the undesired local and
systemic side effects, on account of the slow liberation of the salicylic
acid. It passes the stomach unchanged, the decomposition
beginning in the intestine. Dosage.—0·3 to 1 gramme (5 to 15
grains) in capsules or wafers, or dissolved in sweetened water or dry
on the tongue, followed by a swallow of water. The powder should
be dispensed in waxed paper. Manufactured by Farbenfabriken,
vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co., Elberfeld, Germany (Continental Color
&amp; Chemical Co., New York).</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>BENZOSOL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Benzosol, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OCH<sub>3</sub>) (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COO) = C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, a crystalline compound
of guaiacol in which the hydrogen of the hydroxyl is replaced
by benzoyl.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Benzosol is decomposed slowly in the intestinal
tract into guaiacol and benzoic acid which exert their proper
actions. The liberated constituents are absorbed and excreted in the
urine. It is not irritating. Its uses are analogous to those of creosote
and of benzoic acid. It is recommended in incipient pulmonary
tuberculosis, as an intestinal antiseptic in fermentation, diarrhea,
typhoid fever, diabetes mellitus and as a urinary disinfectant in cystitis,
etc. Dosage.—0·2 to 0·6 gramme (3 to 10 grains), in powder,
capsule, pill, or suspended in liquids or as an emulsion. Manufactured
by Farbwerke, vorm. Meister, Lucius &amp; Bruening, Hoechst a.
M. (Victor Koechl &amp; Co., New York).</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>BETA-EUCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Beta-eucaine hydrochloride, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COO)·HCl, the
hydrochloride of 2,6,6 trimethyl-4-benzoyl-hydroxypiperidine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Beta-eucaine hydrochloride is a local anesthetic
like cocaine, but weaker and devoid of the stimulating properties of
the latter. It does not dilate the pupil, nor does it contract the
blood-vessels as does cocaine. It has the advantage of stability even
on prolonged boiling. It may be used in all cases in which cocaine
is indicated as a local anesthetic, especially in ophthalmology.
Dosage.—It may be applied in a 2 to 3 per cent. solution to the eye,
5 to 10 per cent. for nose and throat, and 5 to 10 per cent. for ointment
for hemorrhoids. Manufactured by Chemische Fabrik auf
Actien, vorm. E. Schering, Berlin (Schering &amp; Glatz, New York).</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>
  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>BETA-NAPHTHOL BENZOATE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Beta-naphthol benzoate, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·COO·C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>7</sub> = C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the benzoic
ester of β-naphthol.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Beta-naphthol benzoate is split up into its
constituents on reaching the intestinal tract and acts as an antiseptic.
It is said to be diuretic. It is used internally as an intestinal
antiseptic in diarrhea and typhoid fever. Externally it has been
recommended as a parasiticide in the form of 3 to 10 per cent. ointment,
and has been used in psoriasis, eczema, scabies, etc. Dosage.—0·2
to 0·5 gramme (3 to 8 grains); maximum dose, single, 1
gramme (15 grains), daily 4 grammes (60 grains). Manufactured by
Fabrik von Heyden, Radebeul near Dresden (Merck &amp; Co., New
York).</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>BETOL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Betol, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>·OH·COO (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>7</sub>) = C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the salicylic ester of
β-naphtol.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Betol is not affected in the stomach, but is
split up in its original components when it reaches the intestinal
tract by the pancreatic juice and intestinal secretions. It is believed
to act as an intestinal antiseptic and, being excreted in the urine, to
act in a similar way in the bladder. It has the anti-rheumatic properties
of salicylic acid. It is recommended for intestinal fermentations,
catarrh of the bladder, particularly in gonorrheal cystitis, for
rheumatism, etc. Dosage.—0·3 to 0·5 gramme (4 to 8 grains) in
cachets, milk or emulsion. Manufactured by the Heyden Chemical
Works, New York.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>BISMAL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Bismal, 4 (C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>10</sub>)·3Bi(OH)<sub>3</sub> = Bi<sub>3</sub>C<sub>60</sub>H<sub>57</sub>O<sub>49</sub>, a compound of
bismuth hydroxide and methylendigallic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Bismal is an astringent and is recommended
for the treatment of chronic diarrhea. Dosage.—0·12 to 0·3
gramme (2 to 5 grains) in cachets or powder. Manufactured by E.
Merck, Darmstadt. (Merck &amp; Co., New York.)</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>BOROCHLORETONE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A mixture of 1 part chloretone with 3 parts boric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—An antiseptic and anesthetic, used externally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>as a surgical dressing powder.  Prepared by Parke, Davis &amp; Co.,
Detroit, Mich.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>BROMETONE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Brometone, 1,1,1-tribrom-2-methyl-propan-2-ol, CBr<sub>3</sub>·C(OH)
(CH<sub>3</sub>)·CH<sub>3</sub> = C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>7</sub>OBr<sub>3</sub>, produced by the reaction of acetone on
bromoform.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Brometone is claimed to have the sedative
action of the bromides without the disadvantage of producing
bromism. In doses of 0·3 gramme (5 grains) four or five times a
day, in adults, it is claimed to cause no unpleasant results and to produce
no disturbance of the digestive organs, and to have no appreciable
effect on the secretions. Its action is prompt and its effect is
manifest for several hours. In doses exceeding 1·6 grammes (25
grains) daily it may produce dizziness, vertigo, anorexia, and mental
hebetude, all of which symptoms disappear on discontinuance of its
use. Therapeutically it has been recommended in mild conditions
of excitation and insomnia, in so-called narcotic abstinence, in hysteria,
and in nervous affections generally. It relieves some forms of
cough and is said to produce amelioration in about 60 per cent. of
cases of epilepsy. It has been used to relieve dizziness due to labyrinthine
disturbances. Dosage.—The dose is 0·3 gramme (5 grains),
to be repeated two or three times during twenty-four hours. Manufactured
by Parke, Davis &amp; Co., Detroit, Mich.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>BROMIPIN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A bromine addition product of sesame oil, containing 10 per cent.
of bromine in organic combination.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Bromipin acts like the bromides, but as it
yields its bromine more slowly it is thought to have less tendency
to produce brominism. The combination is not broken up in the
stomach, but a portion of the bromine is split off as soon as the oil
enters the intestine. The oil with the remaining bromine is easily
absorbed, and, similarly to other fats, is largely deposited in the
tissues, where it is slowly split up. It is said to be more lasting in
its action than the bromides. Dosage.—4 c.c. (1 fluidrachm), increased
in cases of epilepsy to from 8 to 32 c.c. (2 to 8 fluidrachms);
in emulsion with peppermint water and syrup, or pure, flavored with
oil of peppermint. Manufactured by E. Merck, Darmstadt. (Merck
&amp; Co., New York.)</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>BROMIPIN—33⅓ PER CENT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A 33⅓ per cent. brominized sesame oil. Manufactured by E.
Merck, Darmstadt. (Merck &amp; Co., New York.)</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>BUTYL-CHLORAL HYDRATE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Actions and Uses.—Its action is similar to that of chloral, except
that it is said to be less depressing and more analgetic. It has been
especially recommended for facial neuralgia. Dosage.—0·3 to 1·3
grammes (5 to 20 grains).</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>CALCIUM ICHTHYOL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A derivative of ichthyol in which calcium is substituted for ammonium.
Manufactured by the Ichthyol Company, Hamburg.
(Merck &amp; Co., New York.)</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>CALOMELOL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A soluble colloidal form of calomel, containing albuminoids.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Its action is the same as that of calomel, but
it is claimed to be superior because of its solubility in water, acting
more rapidly and efficiently. Calomelol is claimed to be non-irritant
and particularly non-toxic. The indications for its use are the
same as for calomel. Dosage.—Internally the same as calomel.
Externally it is used as a dusting powder, mixed with an equal
quantity of starch or of a mixture of starch and zinc oxide, or in
the form of calomelol ointment. It should be guarded from the
light. Manufactured by the Heyden Chemical Works, New York.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>CALOMELOL OINTMENT.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Actions and Uses.—It is a substitute for mercurial ointment, over
which it has the advantage of cleanliness, and it is claimed to be
distinctly superior as an inunction in syphilis, etc. Dosage.—6
grammes (90 grains) daily for inunction in syphilis. Manufactured
by the Heyden Chemical Works, New York.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>CASCARA EVACUANT.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A preparation said to contain a bitterless glucoside, obtained from
the bark of <i>Rhamnus Purshiana</i>, with aromatics.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—It is claimed that this preparation possesses
the laxative properties of cascara sagrada without the bitterness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>which characterizes the ordinary extract. It is recommended for
the treatment of chronic constipation, for which cascara sagrada is
one of the best medicinal agents. Dosage.—As a laxative, 0·6 to
1 c.c. (10 to 15 minims) three times a day; as a purgative, 1·3 to
2 c.c. (20 to 30 minims) morning and evening. Four cubic centimeters
(1 fluidrachm) may be given in obstinate cases. Prepared by
Parke, Davis &amp; Co., Detroit, Mich.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>CASCARA TONIC LAXATIVE GLOBULES.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Each globule is said to contain 0·2 gramme (3 grains) of the bitter
glucosides of <i>Rhamnus Purshiana</i> suspended in a bland fixed oil, to
which aromatics have been added.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—The manufacturers claim that it combines the
laxative action of cascara with tonic properties of the bitter principle
with the advantage of concealment of the disagreeable taste.
Dosage.—One or two globules to be taken before retiring. Prepared
by Parke, Davis &amp; Co., Detroit, Mich.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>CHINAPHENIN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Chinaphenin, CO (NH·C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>23</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) = C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>33</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the
quinine carbonic acid ester of phenetidin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Chinaphenin combines the antiperiodic properties
of quinine with the analgesic power of phenacetin, with the
advantage of tastelessness and asserted freedom from symptoms of
cinchonism produced by the administration of the two remedies in
simple mixture. It is recommended in febrile diseases, especially la
grippe; in spasmodic conditions, such as whooping-cough; in certain
forms of malaria and in neuralgia. Dosage.—Adult: 0·3 to
0·6 gramme (5 to 10 grains) ordinarily, 1·5 to 2 grammes (22 to 30
grains), given in two doses as an antipyretic in neuralgia and malaria;
in whooping-cough: 0·13 to 0·3 gramme (2 to 5 grains), according to
age. Manufactured by Farbenfabriken, vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co.,
Elberfeld, Germany (Continental Color &amp; Chemical Co., New York).</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>CHLORBUTANOL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Chlorbutanol, 1,1,1-trichlor-2-methyl-propan-2-ol, CCl<sub>3</sub>·C
(OH) (CH<sub>3</sub>)·CH<sub>3</sub> = C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>7</sub>OCl<sub>3</sub>, produced by the reaction of acetone
on chloroform.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—It is said to be absorbed unchanged, but to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>be decomposed in the body. It is a local anesthetic with an action
weaker than that of cocaine, but sufficient to prevent vomiting from
gastric irritation. Its antiseptic action is said to be fifteen times as
strong as that of boric acid. It acts on the central nervous system
similarly to chloral, and although the claim has been made that
hypnotic doses are without effect on the circulation and respiration,
independent observers have described a fall of blood pressure and
interference with respiration in animals, and consider it fully as
dangerous as chloral. In man 100 grains caused severe symptoms,
but recovery occurred. It is claimed that no habit is induced, but
this may be referable to its restricted employment. It is recommended
as a mild local anesthetic, in dentistry, etc., as a preservative
for hypodermic solutions, for insomnia, vomiting and for spasmodic
conditions. It is also said to be useful as introductory to
general anesthesia, lessening excitement and nausea. Dosage.—The
dose is from 0·3 to 1·5 gramme (5 to 20 grains) dry or in capsules.
Hypodermically as a local anesthetic a saturated aqueous
solution may be used.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—An anodyne, antiseptic, and emolient solution
for use by inhalation as a very fine spray or nebula. Manufactured
by Parke, Davis &amp; Co., Detroit, Mich.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>CITARIN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Citarin, <img src='images/i_018.png' alt='' class='h100' />, the normal sodium salt of anhydromethylene-citric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—This is one of the compounds which it is
claimed increase the elimination of uric acid by forming very soluble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>compounds with that substance. It has been recommended for gout
and chronic rheumatism. Dosage.—1 to 2 grammes (15 to 30
grains), largely diluted with water. Manufactured by Farbenfabriken,
vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co., Elberfeld, Germany (Continental Color
&amp; Chemical Co., New York).</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>CREOSOTAL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A mixture of carbonic acid esters, analogous to guaiacol carbonate,
prepared from creosote.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Creosotal has the same action as creosote,
but is claimed to be non-toxic and devoid of irritant properties. It
is recommended as a substitute for creosote for internal exhibition
in tuberculosis, pneumonia, and as an intestinal antiseptic. Dosage.—From
0·3 to 2·0 grammes (5 to 30 grains) for children, to 1 to 4
grammes (15 to 60 grains) for adults in milk, coffee, wine, cod-liver
oil or emulsion. Externally it may be applied undiluted. Manufactured
by Farbenfabriken, vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co., Elberfeld,
Germany (Continental Color &amp; Chemical Co., New York). Fabrik
von Heyden, Radebeul, near Dresden.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>DENTALONE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A 30 per cent. solution of chloretone in a mixture of oils of gaultheria,
cloves and cassia.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Dentalone possesses pronounced anesthetic
properties and is intended for use by dentists in the treatment of
exposed nerves in decayed teeth. Prepared by Parke, Davis &amp; Co.,

<h3 class='c007'>DIABETIN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A pure, crystallized fructose (levulose), CH<sub>2</sub>OH·CHOH·CHOH.
CHOH·CO·CH<sub>2</sub>OH = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, absolutely free from dextrose
(ordinary glucose).</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—Levulose is metabolized in the body by other
agencies than those that act on dextrose and most of the other
sugars and appears to be more completely utilized by the diabetic
organism than the other sugars. It is recommended for the nutrition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and for sweetening the food and drink of diabetics, in pulmonary
tuberculosis, infantile malnutrition and marasmus. Dosage:—It
is given in diabetes in daily quantities of 30 to 60 grammes (1 to
2 ounces); in grave forms of the disease the amount is reduced
to from 12 to 24 grammes (3 to 6 drachms) daily. Manufactured by
Chemische Fabrik auf Actien, vorm. E. Schering, Berlin (Schering

H<sub>2</sub>O), the hydrochloride of the ethyl ester of morphine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Actions and Uses.—It is claimed that this compound acts like
morphine without producing constipation, nausea or lassitude. It
is the conclusion of some good observers that it possesses no advantage
over codeine. Applied to the eye, it causes a local vasodilation,
leading to acute conjunctival edema. Dionin is recommended
to relieve pain, especially in respiratory affections, as an
antispasmodic in whooping-cough, for insomnia and externally in
the treatment of corneal affections, conjunctivitis, iritis, etc.
Dosage.—0·015 to 0·06 gramme (¼ to 1 grain). Externally it is

</div>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>TYREE’S ANTISEPTIC POWDER.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Tyree’s antiseptic powder was assigned for examination to a subcommittee
of the Council, which made the following report:</p>

<p class='c005'><i>To the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</i>: Your subcommittee,
to whom was assigned Tyree’s Pulv. Antiseptic Comp., marketed by
J. S. Tyree, Washington, D. C., reports as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>The label on the package states: “This preparation is a scientific
combination of borate of sodium, alumen, carbolic acid, glycerin and
the crystallized principles of thyme, eucalyptus, gaultheria, and
mentha, in the form of a powder,” etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>The statement that the powder contains the crystalline principles
of thyme, eucalyptus, gaultheria and mentha is vague and misleading,
since the chief medical constituents of eucalyptus and gaultheria
are liquids, but it tends to convey the impression that the
powder contains the essential constituents of these drugs, namely,
thymol, oil of eucalyptus or eucalyptol, oil of wintergreen, or methyl
salicylate, and menthol.</p>

<p class='c006'>The literature supplied to physicians claims its composition to be:
“Parts, sod. bor., 50; alumen, 50; ac. carbol., 5; glycerin, 5; the
cryst. principles of thyme, 5; eucalyptus, 5; gaultheria, 5, and
mentha, 5.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The composition, therefore, might be expressed as follows:—</p>

<table class='table0' summary='composition'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c009'>Sodium borate (borax)</td>
    <td class='c010'>50 parts, or</td>

    <td class='c011'>3·85 per cent.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c006'>Analysis of specimens purchased from different sources in the
open market were made under our direction. The reports of the
chemists show that Tyree’s antiseptic powder contains no borax, or
mere traces only, and that it contains no alum, or mere traces only.
Instead, the analyses show that boric acid and zinc sulphate are the
essential constituents. The amounts of carbolic acid, thymol, menthol,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>etc., contained in the powder, if present, were far below the
quantities indicated by the formula. The presence of glycerin could
not be demonstrated, and if present the amount must be very small.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our chemist reports:—</p>

<p class='c006'>The result of analysis shows that different samples differ slightly
in composition, but that the following indicates the average composition
of the product:—</p>

<table class='table0' summary='composition'>
  <tr>
    <th class='c009'></th>
    <th class='c011'><span class='small'>Per cent.</span></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c009'>Zinc sulphate, anhydrous</td>
    <td class='c011'>15.56.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c009'>Boric acid</td>
    <td class='c011'>81.26.</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='c009'>Volatile matter at 100 C. for four hours</td>
    <td class='c011'>0.45.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c006'>The undetermined portion consists of salicylic acid, carbolic
acid, menthol and eucalyptol; possibly other antiseptic agents may
be present in very minute quantities.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the above findings we conclude that Tyree’s antiseptic
powder is a mixture of boric acid and dried zinc sulphate and antiseptic
bodies, such as menthol, salicylic acid and carbolic acid, eucalyptol,
etc. From this it can be readily seen that the label which
is supposed to set forth the composition of Tyree’s antiseptic powder
is not in accord with the facts. The powder does not contain
either borate of sodium or alum, and the presence of glycerin could
not be established. The antiseptic agents, exclusive of the boric
acid, are present only in small amounts.</p>

<p class='c006'>The report of another analyst concludes as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>It evidently contains less than the amount stated of the principles
of thyme, eucalyptus, wintergreen and mint. It also contains a very
small amount indeed of carbolic acid, much less than that stated.
We have been unable to identify certainly the presence of glycerin,
and it is doubtful if it be present.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the result of the analysis we feel confident that the preparation
is to all intents and purposes a mixture of boric acid and sulphate
of zinc.</p>

<p class='c006'>The carbolic acid, thyme, eucalyptus, wintergreen, etc., if present,
are present only in sufficient amount to give the compound a satisfactory
odor.</p>

<p class='c006'>In view of the fact that J. S. Tyree has given wide publicity to a
formula which the preceding report has shown to be a deliberate
misrepresentation of fact, it is recommended that the article be
refused recognition by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>that this report be published in the <cite>Journal of the American Medical
Association</cite>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The recommendation of the subcommittee was adopted by the
Council in accordance with which the report is published.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a letter to the editor of the <cite>Journal of the American Medical
Association</cite>, Mr. Tyree admits changing the formula of the powder,
and says that it had been his intention to state to the medical profession
his reasons for making the change. In commenting on the
letter it is noted that Mr. Tyree does not state whether the change
was made one year ago or five years ago, but the sample for the
first analysis was purchased last February, and the first chemist’s
report was submitted to the Council March 5, 1906. On April 4th,
Mr. Tyree was notified by the Council that the composition of
“Tyree’s Antiseptic Powder” did not correspond with the formula
published by him. Whether or not Mr. Tyree is justified in offering
to physicians a preparation as composed chiefly of borax and alum,
when in reality it is composed of boric acid and zinc sulphate, is
left for physicians to judge.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>FRAUD AND DECEPTION IN PREPARATIONS OF COD-LIVER OIL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The <cite>Journal of the American Medical Association</cite>, October 13,
1906, exposes the fraud and deception practised by certain proprietary
firms in putting on the market preparations purporting to contain
cod-liver oil, when, in fact, they contain no oil at all. It is
conceded by pharmacologists that the value of these remedies depends
on the nutritive power of the fat, and any preparation which
contains fat must respond to simple tests which the physician can
personally apply. The preparations claiming to represent cod-liver
oil are in liquid form, and if they contain oil it must be in one of
the following forms:</p>

<p class='c006'>(1) An emulsion of the oil which may be miscible with water, but
from which the fat tends to separate and rise to the top. In this
form the fat can be seen as globules under the microscope.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2) A solution, resulting from the saponification of the oil, containing
a soap which usually will be alkaline in reaction, especially
when mixed with water, and from which fatty acids are separated
as a precipitate when the solution is acidified.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>(3) A solution of fatty acids. This will be acid in reaction and
will be precipitated by the addition of water, in which the fatty
acids are not soluble.</p>

<p class='c006'>An examination of one of these preparations, <i>e. g.</i>, Waterbury’s
Metabolized Cod-Liver Oil, which, it is claimed, “contains the metabolized
product obtained by the action of ferments on cod-liver
oil,” shows that it is neither an emulsion, a solution of soap, nor a
solution of fatty acids, and more careful analysis shows that it contains
no fat or fat acids (except the merest traces). No intelligent
physician should be misled by the extravagant and unfounded claims
made for this preparation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hagee’s Cordial of Cod-Liver Oil is a representative of a class of
preparations which claim to “represent the oil, but contain no fat,”
and are therefore practically worthless. The claims of therapeutic
value for such preparations can not be substantiated. Some such
remedies are advertised as extracts of cod-liver oil, when, in fact,
they are made from cod livers, but not from cod-liver oil. These
preparations, if honestly made, might be worthy of a trial, but they
are not preparations of cod-liver oil, and should not be so termed.
So far as we know, however, no satisfactory evidence is forthcoming
that such extractives have any therapeutic value.</p>

<p class='c006'>The attempt to modify cod-liver oil for therapeutic purposes may
be pronounced a failure and the large variety and extensive sale of
these preparations appear to be owing to the fact that physicians
do not recall the ordinary facts of chemistry, but accept too readily
the statements of the manufacturers.</p>

<p class='c005'><cite>The Food and Drugs Act, June 30, 1906</cite>, continues to be the
leading topic for discussion in pharmaceutical journals and in pharmaceutical
circles generally. In many of the larger cities special
meetings have been held at which the probable effect of the law,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>directly as well as indirectly, on the several branches of pharmacy
have been discussed at length.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wholesale druggists and manufacturing pharmacists appear to be
heartily in favor of the underlying principles and of the general
provisions of the Federal pure food and drug law, despite the fact
that it has imposed an enormous amount of additional work and
expense for which they can scarcely expect to be adequately recompensed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The proposition to endorse the Federal law, by corresponding
laws in the several States, has aroused considerable opposition on
the part of retail pharmacists, who appear to be either indifferent
or else fearful lest the additional obligations that would be imposed
on them might be too exacting or else involve an undue amount of
work or expense to comply with.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this connection we should remember that pharmacists, as such,
have taken little or no part in securing the enactment of the Federal
pure food and drug law, and that, as a consequence, they have thus
sacrificed no little of their professional independence and prestige.</p>

<p class='c006'>This apathy on the part of pharmacists is even now being taken
advantage of by members of boards of health, Food and Dairy
Commissioners and well-meaning but frequently misinformed reformers
who are actively at work to secure food and drug legislation
along the lines of the National law.</p>

<p class='c006'>In by far the greater number of State legislatures, now in session,
bills for laws of this kind have been introduced, and whether enacted
into laws or not, will tend to show the wants or desires of retail
pharmacists, and, if opposed or ignored, will seriously reflect on the
ability and professional disinterestedness of pharmacists themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Retail pharmacists should, and if they desire to maintain their
standing in the community they must, favor pure food and drug
legislation that is designed to protect the public. By themselves
taking an active interest in the securing of legislation along these
lines they could readily prevent the enactment of ill-advised measures
that would tend to hamper or restrict them in the pursuance
of their business.</p>

<p class='c006'>That the medical profession in all sections of the country is
clearly in favor of pure food and drug legislation was plainly evidenced
at the Conference of the Committee on Medical Legislation,
of the American Medical Association, with the National Legislative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Council, held at Washington, D.C., December 13th to 15th inclusive.</p>

<p class='c006'>State legislation was discussed at some length and the representatives
of the several State Medical Associations who were present
expressed themselves in no uncertain way as being in favor of the
individual States endorsing the Federal Food and Drugs Act.</p>

<p class='c006'>The proceedings of this conference have been published in
pamphlet form, comprising sixty-eight pages of closely printed
material. This pamphlet contains much that is of interest to pharmacists,
and may be obtained from the Secretary of the Bureau of
Medical Legislation of the American Medical Association, 103 Dearborn
Avenue, Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p class='c006'>The available literature on pure food and drug legislation is
rapidly assuming huge proportions. In addition to the liberal space
that is devoted to the question in the current numbers of pharmaceutical
journals, a number of reprints of material of this kind
have appeared. Not the least interesting of these reprints is a
pamphlet of sixty-four pages entitled:—</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Food and Drug Act as it relates to drugs</i>, examined and
explained in connection with the rules and regulations for its
enforcement. This pamphlet is published by the <cite>National Druggist</cite>,
St. Louis, Mo., and contains in addition to the law itself and the
regulations pertaining to it, a number of interesting decisions and
much additional material bearing more or less directly on the
proper interpretation of the Food and Drugs Act.</p>

<p class='c006'><cite>Digest of National Food and Drugs Act and Regulations</cite>, by
Mahlon N. Kline, is the title of a pamphlet containing upwards of
seventy-two pages that has recently been sent out with the compliments
of the Smith, Kline, French Company, Philadelphia. In
addition to a transcript of the Food and Drugs Act, and of the
rules and regulations for the enforcement of the same, this pamphlet
also contains a number of additional opinions, replies and
explanations that have been published from time to time; also a
legal exposition of the Food and Drugs Act by George L. Douglas,
attorney for the Proprietary Association of America; extracts from
the recently published “Standard of Purity for Food Products,”
and much additional information of interest to retail pharmacists.</p>

<p class='c006'><cite>The Ladies’ Home Journal Bill</cite>, or a corresponding measure to
regulate the manufacture and sale of so-called patent medicines, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>been introduced in upwards of ten of the State legislatures now in
session. This bill, originally published in the <cite>Ladies’ Home Journal</cite>
about a year ago, is essentially a formula on the label bill and provides,
in addition, that preparations containing one or more of
certain specified drugs be labeled poison.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Anti-narcotic legislation</i> is also receiving a fair proportion of attention.
The most drastic of these measures is probably the one that
has been introduced into the legislature of the State of New York,
at the instance of the <cite>Evening Journal</cite>. This bill prohibits the sale
of opium, chloral, cocaine, eucaine or acetanilid, or any preparation
containing them, except on the original written prescription of a
physician, dentist or veterinarian.</p>

<p class='c006'>In several States, notably Texas and Missouri, bills are pending
that are designed to improve or to revise the laws governing the

<p class='c006'><cite>Patent Reform Bill.</cite>—Representative Currier, Chairman of the
House Committee on Patents, has introduced a bill to substitute the
much discussed Mann bill. This bill, popularly known as the
Currier bill, is practically a revival of the reciprocity feature of the
original Mann bill, but is not restricted to medicine, or medicinal
products and includes patents of all kinds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Currier bill provides: “That any patent issued to a citizen
or subject of a foreign country, shall be upon the same conditions
and for the same term as are patents issued by such country to
citizens of the United States.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This single provision, it is said, would effectually correct the evils
arising from our present system of process and product patents, but
would be contrary to the terms of the International Convention for
the protection of industrial property and will no doubt be vigorously
opposed on this ground.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Incorporation of the Public Health Defense League.</i> A bill has
been introduced into the Legislature of the State of New York providing
for the incorporation of the Public Health Defense League,
under a special charter patterned after that of the Red Cross
Society.</p>

<p class='c006'>The object of this new society is announced as being an organized
movement against medical and surgical quacks, frauds in patent
medicines or nostrums, and an effort to obtain and to disseminate
accurate information concerning practices and conditions of every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>kind that are dangerous to the public health and morals. (<cite>Journal
A. M. A.</cite>, 1907, page 236.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Sunday Rest in France.</i>—Pharmacists in France are not alone
adapting themselves to the recently enacted Sunday Rest Law, but
are even going farther and are adopting earlier hours for closing
during the week.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Grenoble, where Sunday closing has been in vogue for some
time, the pharmacists have decided to close at 8 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> daily and to
organize a night service by rotation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The syndicate of Paris pharmacists recommends that its members
adopt 9 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> as the hour for closing during the week and to close
from midday till the following morning on Sundays and bank holidays.
(<cite>Chem. and Drug.</cite>, 1906, page 775.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Popularity of Pasteur in France.</i>—The <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petit Parisien</span></cite> has taken a
rather interesting plebiscite as to who is thought to be the greatest of
nineteenth century Frenchmen. In the voting Pasteur took the
lead from the first, followed by Victor Hugo, Gambetta, Napoleon I,
Thiers and Lazare Carnot, in the order named. (<cite>Chem. and Drug.</cite>,
1907, page 6.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Doses in the Codex.</i>—The Codex Revision Committee has decided
to include a list of maximum doses in a supplement to the Codex,
and has delegated the work of drawing up such a list to a special
committee including MM. Laudouszy, Marty, Bourquelot, Gilbert
and Yvon. (<cite>Chem. and Drug.</cite>, Dec., 1906, page 884.)</p>

<p class='c006'><cite>The Druggists’ Circular</cite> has rounded out a half century of its
existence. The January, 1907, number of this journal constitutes a
fiftieth anniversary number and comprises a total of 320 pages.
The 190 or more pages that are devoted to reading matter contain
quite an exhaustive review of American pharmacy during the
past fifty years. All of the more interesting articles are liberally
illustrated and the number itself will no doubt be appreciated as an
album of men who have contributed, or are now contributing, to the
development of the science of pharmacy in America.</p>

<p class='c006'><cite>Incompatibility of Pepsin and Pancreatin in liquid preparations.</cite>—A
report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American
Medical Association (<cite>Journal American Medical Association</cite>,
February 2, 1907, p. 434) calls renewed attention to the generally
well-known fact that despite the frequently made statement that
pepsin and pancreatin must be incompatible in liquid preparations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>a number of such mixtures are still being offered by manufacturers
or retail pharmacists and are used by physicians.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Council has investigated a number of preparations of this
type and has invariably found them to be practically inert in at least
some of the claims made for them. Having demonstrated that pepsin
and pancreatin cannot exist in one and the same solution for
any reasonable length of time and that preparations that are said to
contain these two ferments are sold under impossible claims, the
Council recommends:</p>

<p class='c006'>(1) That the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry refuse to approve
liquid preparations that are claimed to contain both pepsin
and pancreatin.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2) That the medical profession through the <cite>Journal of the
American Medical Association</cite> be advised of the fallacy of employing
such combinations.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3) That the attention of manufacturers be called to the worthlessness
of such incompatible liquid preparations of pepsin and pancreatin
and that they be urged to cease offering such products to
the profession.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4) That since the National Formulary has recognized a preparation
of this kind under the title “Elixir Digestivum Compositum”
the American Pharmaceutical Association be requested to instruct
its committee on the National Formulary to omit this preparation
from the next edition.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Acetanilid Mixtures.</i>—The mixtures of acetanilid and other ingredients
that formerly were exploited as definite chemical compounds
are now being marketed as mixtures, and, in some cases at least,
have had their composition changed so as to be totally unrecognizable.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Antikamnia</i>, under the regulations of the Pure Food and Drugs
Act, is being marketed as a mixture containing 350 grains of acetphenetidin
in each ounce. Pharmacists who are in the habit of
filling prescriptions for physicians calling for “antikamnia” in solution
will now experience the additional difficulty of being obliged
to explain why the new antikamnia differs from the old in its physical
properties.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Ammonol.</i>—This preparation is said to be Ammoniumphenylacetamid
on one portion of its label and directly under it is said to
contain 240 grains of paracetyl-phenetidin in each ounce.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span><i>Phenalgin</i>, marketed as an ammoniated phenylacetamide, is labeled
as containing 50 per cent. of acetanilidum.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Benzosalin.</i>—Methyl benzoyl salicylate occurs as a white crystalline
powder having a slight aromatic odor and taste. The substance
melts at from 84 to 85° C. It is nearly insoluble in water,
but is soluble in 35 parts of alcohol and is readily soluble in chloroform
but somewhat less so in ether. (<cite>Phar. Centralh.</cite>, 1906, p. 1053.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Borovertin.</i>—This is the name that has been applied to hexamethylene
tetramine triborate. The substance occurs as a yellowish
white powder readily soluble in water and having a distinctly bitter
taste. It may be given in doses of from 1 to 4 grammes daily.
(<cite>Phar. Centralh.</cite>, 1906, p. 928.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Castor oil in form of powder.</i>—A recently issued German patent
describes a process for preparing a supposedly active preparation
of castor oil in powder form. This is accomplished by the addition
of light calcined magnesia to an emulsion of castor oil, or by adding
a specific quantity of castor oil to the same weight of calcined magnesia
that has been moistened with distilled water, and drying the
resulting mixture and powdering the residue. (<cite>Phar. Centralh.</cite>,
1907, p. 65.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Cystopurin.</i>—This is said to be a combination of one molecule of
hexamethylene tetramine with two molecules of sodium acetate. It
occurs as white, nearly tasteless crystals that are readily soluble in
either hot or cold water. Cystopurin may be administered in doses
of 1 or 2 grammes three times a day. (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Phar. Zeit.</span></cite>, 1907, page 48.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Forgenin.</i>—This is said to be tetra methyl ammonium formiate and
responds to all of the known reactions for formic acid compounds.
It is being recommended, in small doses, as a heart tonic. (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Phar.
Zeit.</span></cite>, 1907, page 48.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Levurinose</i> is a name given to a yeast that has been desiccated by
means of a current of cold air so as to preserve the individual yeast
cells intact. This preparation has been recommended to be used in
affections of the skin, such as acne, eczema, furunculosis, urticaria,
etc. (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Phar. Zeit.</span></cite>, 1907, page 47.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mistura Strzyzowski</i> is the formidable name, applied in Austria,
to a mixture containing ferric pyrophosphate, quinine hydrochloride
and sodium bromide. This mixture is directed to be prepared as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Sodium bromide 8·00 is dissolved in distilled water, 40·00; syrup
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>of orange peel, 20·00; alcohol, 10·00. Mix and add a solution of
quinine hydrochloride, 1·00 in distilled water, 40·00; and syrup of
orange peel, 20·00. Mix, and then add the following, prepared by
slightly warming: Ferric pyrophosphate with ammonium citrate,
4·00 in distilled water, 40·00. Mix, and add syrup of orange peel,
40·00.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dose, one to two teaspoonfuls, with water, two or three times a
day.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Novaspirin</i> is the name applied to methyl citric acid ester of
salicylic acid. It occurs as a white powder having a slightly acid
taste. It is nearly insoluble in water but is readily soluble in alcohol.
Novaspirin may be given in doses of 1 gramme three times a day.
(<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Phar. Zeit.</span></cite>, 1907, page 9.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Quinine Phytinate.</i>—Anhydro oxymethylene diphosphate of quinine
occurs as a yellow powder, very soluble in water but almost
insoluble in alcohol, ether, benzin or chloroform. The substance
contains 57 per cent. of quinine and has an intensely bitter taste.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Scarlatin Marpman</i> is an antitoxin preparation that, given internally,
is being used as a prophylactic for scarlet fever. It is said to
be produced by inoculating animals with infectious material from
scarlet fever patients and inoculating other animals with the serum
taken from the first. The serum from the blood of the second
animal is used to immunize other animals, and it is from these
immunized animals that the antitoxin serum is prepared.</p>

<p class='c006'>Scarlatin is a yellowish, opalescent liquid having a slight odor and
a salty taste. The substance has a specific gravity of from 1·012 to
1·013, is neutral in reaction and gives a copious precipitate with
reagents for albumin. (<cite>Phar. Centralh.</cite>, 1907, page 69.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Solubility of Salicin.</i>—D. B. Dott (<cite>Phar. Jour.</cite>, 1907, page 79)
finds that the solubility of salicin, as given in the British Pharmacopœia
(1 in 28) is practically correct, while that of the U. S. P. (1 in
21 at 25° C.) is too high.</p>

<p class='c006'>Using pure salicin, that melted at 201° C., he finds that it has a
solubility of 1 in 24 at 25° C., or very nearly that called for by the
British Pharmacopœia at ordinary temperatures.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Substitutes for Cocaine.</i>—Dr. Hugo Wintersteiner (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Mea.
Wochensch.</span></cite>, 1906, page 1339) reports a comprehensive comparative
study of the use of cocaine and its various substitutes in eye work.
Of the numerous substances that have been proposed from time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>to time he describes tropococain, holocain, eucain, stovain, alypin
and novocain at some length and concludes that while it is true
that these substances are relatively more stable than cocain, and are
therefore more readily sterilized, the numerous objectionable
features, such as unreliability, irritating properties and the production
of a hyperemia, are so much more objectionable that cocaine
must be admitted to be by far the most satisfactory as well as the
safest local anesthetic in all varieties of eye work.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Tannisol</i> is a reddish-brown, odorless and tasteless powder that is
insoluble in water, ether or benzine, but is soluble in alcohol and in
dilute solutions of alkalies or of the alkaline carbonates. It is
directed to be used internally in cases of intestinal catarrh, and
externally for a variety of inflammatory conditions of the skin.
Internally it may be given in doses of 0·50 gramme (<cite>Phar. Centralh.</cite>,
1906, page 1006).</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Theolactin.</i>—This name has been applied to a double salt of theobromin
sodium and sodium lactate. It occurs as a white hygroscopic
powder, readily soluble in water and having a distinctly bitter
taste. It is said to be an active diuretic, but is not free from
occasional side effects in the form of gastric disturbances. (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Phar.
Zeit.</span></cite>, 1907, page 49.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Tinctura olea Europeae.</i>—A tincture made with 60 per cent. alcohol
from the dried leaves of the European olive has been used as a
febrifuge as well as a general tonic in place of the tincture of cinchona
bark.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Triacetyl morphin.</i>—This substance has been isolated from a mixture
of acetyl derivatives of morphin. Triacetyl morphin melts at
from 206 to 208° C., is only slightly soluble in water or cold alcohol,
but is readily soluble in acids. With hydrochloric acid it forms a
salt that crystallizes in the form of long needles. (<cite>Phar. Centralh.</cite>,
1906, page 928.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Tulaselactin</i> is the name given by Behring to a substance that is
expected to immunize infants against tuberculosis. (<cite>Phar. Centralh.</cite>,
1907, page 24.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Tulase</i> (<cite>A. J. P.</cite>, 1906, page 582) is the name given by Behring
to his immunizing and curative serum for tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c006'>This preparation is said to contain all of the constituents of the
Koch bacillus. It occurs as a clear fluid which has the general outward
characteristics of thin honey. It may be given subcutaneously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>intravenously or by mouth. The mixture of tulase with milk, mentioned
above, is the form in which it may be administered to infants.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tulase is now being used in an experimental way, but Behring
himself warns against too much reliance being placed on the curative
properties of the substance.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sccite'>Elements of General Chemistry with Experiments.</span> By John
H. Long, M.S., Sc.D., Professor of Chemistry and Director of the
Chemical Laboratories in the Northwestern University Medical
School. Fourth edition, revised and enlarged. Illustrated. Philadelphia:
P. Blakiston’s Son &amp; Co., 1906.</p>

<p class='c006'>That Professor Long was more than justified in writing this textbook
is shown by the fact that since the appearance of the first
edition in 1888 two other editions have been issued, and it has been
necessary now to issue a fourth edition. The time has gone by
in all of the sciences when it can be said that a student is acquainted
with fundamental principles unless he has repeated some of the classroom
work in the laboratory. As Dr. Long well says: “Repetition
is necessary to fix elementary principles thoroughly in the mind of
the beginner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The present edition contains some additional matter on the theories
of solution, the conditions of chemical equilibrium, some newer
views of chemical theory and the description of several new substances.
The book is a remarkably good one for the beginner, and
is well adapted to the needs of the Freshmen class in any of the
colleges where a general course in inorganic chemistry is given.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sccite'>Chemical Abstracts.</span> Published by the American Chemical Society.
Vol. I, Nos. 1 and 2. Easton, Pa.: The Chemical Publishing
Co. January 1 and 20, 1907.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under this title the American Chemical Society has begun the
publication of an independent semi-monthly periodical which shall
furnish to American chemists at short intervals a full and comprehensive
series of abstracts covering the whole range of pure
and applied chemical science together with the titles of American,
British, French and German patents on chemical subjects.</p>

<p class='c006'>The importance and value of this undertaking can hardly be
over-estimated. The Journal of the English Chemical Society has
long covered somewhat similar ground, but hardly in the complete
manner that our American society has now attempted; the Journal
of the Society of Chemical Industry has always made a feature of
its abstracts and patent references, but these cover applied chemistry
only; the German Chemical Society some years ago took over the
publication along with its <i>Berichte</i> of the <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chemische Centralblatt</span></cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>for this same purpose of furnishing a complete series of abstracts,
but it was felt that our American Chemical Society should take up
this work for its own membership, now numbering over 3000
chemists.</p>

<p class='c006'>So the Society for the future will publish its Journal as a monthly
for original papers and communications, of which it has as many
as it can possibly find room for in its twelve issues, and the Abstract
Journal as a semi-monthly, covering the whole field of pure and
applied chemistry under some 30 subdivisions, of which pharmaceutical
chemistry is one. That this subject will be cared for in an
appreciative and intelligent way can be assumed, as we note that
Prof. A. B. Stevens of Ann Arbor is in charge of the abstracts in
this field. For those who are not members of the Society the subscription
price is as follows: Journal of the American Chemical
Society, monthly, $6; Chemical Abstracts, semi-monthly, $6; for
both journals sent to the same subscriber, $10. Members of the
American Chemical Society receive both journals for the annual
membership fee of $8.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE PHILADELPHIA BRANCH OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL ASSOCIATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The regular stated meeting of the Philadelphia Branch of the
American Pharmaceutical Association was held on the evening of
Friday, January 4, 1907, and was attended by 63 members and
visitors.</p>

<p class='c006'>The minutes of the previous meeting were read and declared
approved.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Committee on Sunday Closing and the Committee on State
Legislation made preliminary reports that were received and ordered
filed.</p>

<p class='c006'>On behalf of the Committee on State Legislation Mr. Cliffe said
that members of the committee had had an opportunity to confer
with the members of a special committee of the State Legislature
on the subject and that a joint conference of members of committees
interested in the enactment of a State Food and Drug Law would
be held at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy on the evening of
Tuesday, January 15, 1907.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>The regular program for the evening was then proceeded with.
This consisted of a discussion of “The Debasing Influences of
Fraudulent Nostrums.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The first communication, by Dr. Solomon Solis Cohen, was devoted
to the consideration of “Secrecy and Fraud as Deterring
Factors to the Progress of Medicine.” Dr. Cohen, in the course of
his remarks, said that progress means an ascent from little or no
knowledge to knowledge, and from knowledge to greater knowledge.
Secrecy is the withholding of knowledge and breeds ignorance,
while fraud is even worse than ignorance in that it is designed to
mislead.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Cohen also asserted that therapeutics was difficult enough
under the most favorable conditions and that in cases where a physician
is confronted with secrecy or fraud, in the statements made in
connection with medicinal preparations, he is likely to be misled
himself and to do untold harm to his patients.</p>

<p class='c006'>In concluding, the speaker referred to a number of specific preparations
which have been discovered to differ materially in composition
from what was claimed for them. He also expressed the
hope that the Federal Pure Food and Drugs Law would be instrumental
in leading manufacturers to more duly appreciate the need
for a greater degree of honesty in the exploitation of their wares.
If pharmacy is to make progress and if medicine is to make progress
it will necessitate a full and complete knowledge of the composition
and action of the substances used in the treatment of
diseases.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next communication, by Dr. Henry Leffmann, dealt with:
“Known and Unknown Changes in the Composition of well-known
Nostrums.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Leffmann said that the question of secrecy was one of the most
intricate problems and one that involved a number of factors.</p>

<p class='c006'>Secrecy in connection with nostrums, the composition of which
was known only to some one or more individuals, but not to all
was an objectionable feature and frequently led to arbitrary and in
many instances dangerous changes in the composition and the
action of nostrums.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Leffmann then called attention to a number of specific instances
in which it was known that changes had been made in the composition
of widely advertised nostrums and also pointed out how these
changes might be injurious to the consumer.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“Criminal Responsibility in the Sale of Abortifacients” was the
subject matter of the communication by Dr. Henry Beates, Jr.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Beates referred to the various statutes relating to the use,
sale or distribution of abortifacients and condemned, in no uncertain
terms, the practice of advertising, in lay journals, articles designed
to prevent conception or to produce abortion. He held that additional
publicity might well be given to the serious nature of the
questions involved, and urged that steps be taken to prevent the
use of the United States mails by newspapers and magazines publishing
advertisements of abortifacients or of instruments designed
to prevent conception.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. John B. Roberts, in opening the general discussion of the
question, asserted that there certainly could be no difference of
opinion on the degrading influences of practices that, as had been
shown by the previous speakers, tended to convert pharmacists and
pharmaceutical manufacturers into liars and medical practitioners into
frauds and fakirs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The subject matter was further discussed by Dr. Henry W. Cattell,
Dr. F. E. Stewart, Dr. C. B. Lowe and Messrs. Remington, LaWall,
Turner, Thum, Beringer, Vanderkleed, Cable, Westcott, Wilbert
and Cliffe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Cliffe presented the following resolutions, which, on motion,
were unanimously adopted:</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Resolved</i> that the Philadelphia Branch of the American Pharmaceutical
Association condemns the advertisement in drug journals,
magazines and newspapers of abortifacient medicines and deprecates
their sale by reputable pharmacists.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Resolved</i> that all members of this branch be urged to exclude
such medicines and articles from their stocks.</p>

<p class='c006'>The secretary then read a communication entitled “Objectionable
Side Lines to the Practice of Medicine,” specifically mentioning
several profit-sharing and stock-distributing schemes that are now
doing business in the city of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c006'>This communication was, on motion, directed to be forwarded to
the Secretary of the Philadelphia County Medical Society with the
offer to submit additional evidence to the officials of that organization.</p>

<p class='c006'>There being no further business the meeting was declared adjourned.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>FEBRUARY MEETING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The regular stated meeting of the Philadelphia Branch of the
American Pharmaceutical Association was held on the evening of
Tuesday, February 5, 1907, in the Hall of the College of Physicians.</p>

<p class='c006'>The subject under discussion, “Higher Educational Requirements
for Pharmacists,” has attracted considerable attention during
the past year or more, and it was therefore not surprising to find that
retail pharmacists attending this meeting were comparatively well
informed on questions relating to education, and fully appreciated
the need for more rapid advancement along educational lines in the
future.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first speaker on the subject, Mr. William L. Cliffe, in discussing
“The Practical Needs for Higher Education in Pharmacy,”
called attention to the fact that the people at large are rapidly
becoming more thoroughly familiarized with the needs and the
wants of the practice of pharmacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>He believes that with the further elimination of empiricism and
mysticism from the science of medicine more will be expected of
pharmacists, and they in turn will be required to be educated in
every way.</p>

<p class='c006'>Prof. Henry Kraemer, in speaking on “Standards in Pharmaceutical
Education,” (see p. <a href='#Page_101'>101</a>) called attention to the fact that
up to the present time the progress of pharmacy in this country
had been comparatively slow and that we are now entering on an
era of more rapid development. He believes that the enactment of
pure food and drug laws will add great additional responsibility to
the duties of the retail pharmacist and will also tend to more sharply
define the corresponding duties of the colleges and of the boards of
pharmacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Horatio C. Wood, Jr., in speaking on “The Future Elaboration
of a Course in Pharmacy,” said that, as a commercial pursuit,
the business of pharmacy must necessarily be one of limited scope
and possibilities; as a profession, however, pharmacy can be developed
into an occupation of laudable aims and high ideals. He believes
that the pharmacist should develop as the assistant and the adviser
of the physician, who in turn must depend more and more on the
efforts of the pharmacist to select for him and to improve on the
efficiency of the available articles of the materia medica.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Prof. I. V. S. Stanislaus, in opening the general discussion, gave
it as his opinion that the pharmacist of the future would again hold
the same relative position to the public as did the apothecary of old.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pharmacist of the future will be the chemist of the people, the
food and drug analyst, the assistant and adviser of the physician,
in all matters relating to materia medica and chemistry, and will,
therefore, practically be the sanitarian of the community.</p>

<p class='c006'>The subject was further discussed by Messrs. John K. Thum,
Franklin Apple, Jacob Eppstein, M. I. Wilbert, H. C. Blair, E. Fullerton
Cook, John Hahn and Dr. F. E. Stewart. From the general
trend of this discussion it was plainly evident that the better
informed retail pharmacists deeply appreciate their responsibility
to the public, and are willing and even anxious to meet their
obligations fully. At no time in the history of pharmacy in this
country has it been so evident that the mentally and morally poor
man should not be allowed to jeopardize the health and even the
lives of his fellow beings as now.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is clearly evident that pharmacists are beginning to realize that
a full and complete appreciation of their duties to society at large
must of necessity react to their own pecuniary advantage and will
in addition procure for them the respect and the admiration of their
fellow men.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>A REVIEW OF THE OPSONINS AND BACTERIAL VACCINES.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c003'><sup>[2]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='small'><span class='sc'>By E. M. Houghton.</span></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As requested by the <cite>Therapeutic Gazette</cite>, I shall attempt to describe
as succinctly as possible the theory of the opsonins and the
therapeutic results that have been obtained by the application of the
new theory. As the years go by we realize more thoroughly the
correctness of the prophetic belief of the “Immortal Pasteur,” that
the day would come when it would be possible to eradicate the infectious
diseases by vaccination.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are indebted to Metchnikoff for calling attention to and explaining
the rôle of the white blood cells in the defence of the body
against bacterial invasion, but the phenomenon of phagocytosis is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>not so simple as it at first appeared, as little by little new facts are
developed which amplify our knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was shown by Denys and Leclef, in 1895, that when rabbits
were immunized against <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> the serum acquired
but slight bactericidal properties, but that such serum, when brought
in contact with the leucocytes of normal or immunized rabbits,
greatly enhanced their phagocytic activity. Conversely no acceleration
of phagocytosis was observed when the corpuscles were brought
in contact with the serum of a normal animal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mennes two years later confirmed this by showing that similar
results were obtained from the blood serum of guinea-pigs treated
with cultures or toxins of Pneumococci.</p>

<p class='c006'>A method of measuring the phagocytic activity of the leucocytes
was developed by Leishman in 1902. In 1903 Wright and Douglas
made an extensive study of the phagocytes, when brought in contact
with suspensions of <i>Staphylococcus pyogenes</i>, and were able to
show:</p>

<p class='c006'>(1) Quoting from the original: “We have here conclusive proof
that the blood fluids modify the bacteria in a manner which renders
them a ready prey to the phagocytes. We may speak of this as an
‘opsonic’ effect (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">opsono</span></i> [a Latin verb], I cater for; I prepare victuals
for), and we may employ the term ‘opsonins’ to designate the elements
in the blood fluids which produce this effect.”</p>

<p class='c006'>(2) Normal blood serum and plasma possess the same opsonic
action upon bacteria.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3) Serum loses its opsonic action when heated to 60° C. This
is spoken of as inactivated serum.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4) Inactivated serum and physiological salt solution have the
same influence upon phagocytosis.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5) “The opsonic power of the blood fluids disappears gradually
on standing,” losing about 50 per cent. of its activity in five or six
days.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6) An anti-opsonic effect is noted when blood serum is digested
with typhoid bacilli.</p>

<p class='c006'>(7) When a condition of immunity is conferred upon patients infected
by Staphylococci, by vaccination with heated cultures of
Staphylococci, the opsonic action of the patient’s blood serum is
greatly augmented.</p>

<p class='c006'>Neufeld and Rimpau (1904) found in antistreptococcic and pneumococcic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>sera evidence of substances which, while inactive towards
leucocytes, possessed very marked opsonic or sensitizing action, as
they termed it, toward corresponding cultures of streptococci and
pneumococci.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross (<cite>Lancet</cite>, November, 1906) summarizes our knowledge of the
opsonins as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>“(1) Opsonins act by chemically uniting with the invading bacteria,
and so altering them that the leucocytes are able to phagocyte
the bacteria and destroy them. It is important to remember that
these substances do not stimulate or otherwise affect the leucocytes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“(2) It is probable that there are present many varieties of opsonins
in the blood plasma, each having to do with combating a particular
kind of microbic invasion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“(3) Opsonins have been shown to be distinct from other
bacteriotropic substances, such as the bacteriolysins, the agglutinins,
and the antitoxins.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The leucocytes of healthy or diseased persons seem to be equally
active when brought in contact with the same serum, hence the
amount of opsonins present in the blood of an individual determines,
according to the opsonic theory, his susceptibility to bacterial
invasion.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>TECHNIQUE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>To measure the resistance of the patient to such invasion, or to
find out his opsonic index, special technique has been developed,
which may be briefly described as follows:</p>

<h4 class='c014'>I. EMULSIONS OF BACTERIA.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Twenty-four-hour or younger growths of the rapid-growing bacteria,
as Staphylococci, Streptococci, Pneumococci, Gonococci and
Colon bacilli, upon inclined agar are washed off with normal saline
solution. After the mixture has sedimented, the upper, whitish
layer composed of fluid and bacteria is removed with a pipette, and
the finer clumps of bacteria precipitated by placing the fluid in a
rapidly rotated centrifuge for a few minutes. The supernatant layer,
which is still opalescent and is called a bacterial emulsion, should if
suitable for work contain the germs in a well-separated condition.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cultures of tubercle germs are heated, and ground in a mortar
with salt solution until the mass is well broken up, and then centrifugated.
In case glycerin cultures are used, such as are left in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>manufacture of Koch’s old tuberculin, the glycerin must be removed
by repeated washing with water and finally with 1·5 per cent. salt
solution. The washed culture is worked up in a mortar and centrifugated
until the clumps are practically all thrown down, and the
cloudy layer or emulsion is removed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The emulsions must be of uniform density. Wright computed
the number of germs in a given volume by counting, but McFarland
and L’Engle devised an apparatus which is called a nephelometer,
consisting essentially of mixtures of BaSO<sub>4</sub>, put up in sealed tubes,
which correspond to solutions containing from 1 to 10 per cent. of
BaCl<sub>2</sub>, which serve as standards. The turbidity of the emulsion is
compared in similar layer with the standard tubes of BaSO<sub>4</sub>. They
found that the tube containing “5 per cent. of BaCl<sub>2</sub> corresponds to
the most useful bacterial suspension.” The permanency of the
emulsions varies a good deal. Suspensions of the gonococci should
be used at once, staphylococci within two days, etc., while the emulsion
of tubercle germs may be employed indefinitely.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>II. WASHED WHITE BLOOD-CORPUSCLES.</h4>

<p class='c008'>The finger or lobe of the ear is punctured as in making a blood
count, and the blood is allowed to drop directly into normal saline,
·85 per cent. solution, containing about 1 per cent. sodium citrate;
this decalcifies the blood and prevents clotting. The corpuscles are
completely precipitated in the centrifuge, and then repeatedly washed
with ·85 per cent. saline and centrifugated, until all traces of the
citrate and serum are removed. After the final precipitation the
saline solution is withdrawn, and the thin upper grayish layer of the
sediment, the leucocytic cream, consisting for the most part of
washed white blood cells, is removed.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>III. THE SERUM.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Blood is obtained in the usual way, but is collected in small, bent,
glass tubes, which can be readily held in the centrifuge and the
serum separated. In obtaining normal serum, care must be exercised
in selecting a healthy subject, or, what is better, obtain serum
from the mixed blood of several normal persons’ “Pool.”</p>

<h4 class='c014'>IV. STAIN.</h4>

<p class='c008'>With the exception of Malta fever and tubercle bacilli, Leishman’s
stain, consisting of eosin and methylene-blue, in combination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>or Jenner’s stain, is employed. Carbol-fuchsin is employed for the
tubercle bacilli.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>METHOD OF OBTAINING OPSONIC INDEX.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Special capillary pipettes, graduated into equal divisions, are required;
then by means of a rubber tube or bulb equal quantities of
washed corpuscles, bacterial emulsion, and patient’s serum are taken
up, and all blown out upon a glass slide and thoroughly mixed. The
mixture is then drawn up in a small pipette, sealed, and placed in
an incubator of the ordinary type, or preferably in an opsonic incubator
as proposed by Freeman; it is heated to 37° to 40° C. for
fifteen minutes. A similar tube is prepared, except that the normal
serum or “Pool” is employed instead of the patient’s serum. At
the end of fifteen minutes the smears on microscopical slides are
made from each tube, fixed, and stained. A good field is selected,
one containing many leucocytes, the number of germs counted in
the first fifty or hundred observed, and an average per leucocyte
determined. If the average in the mixture containing the normal
serum is two, we would say that the normal opsonic index is two,
and if the mixture containing the patient’s blood serum is one per
corpuscle, we would say that his index was one-half, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wright and his pupils, as the result of numerous observations,
classify diseases due to bacterial infections:</p>

<p class='c006'>(1) “Diseases in which the bacterial process is strictly localized”
or “shut off from the lymph and blood circulations.” Furunculosis,
lupus, tuberculosis, etc., in fact most chronic infections, belong to this
class. “In this class the opsonic index of the blood is persistently
below normal, owing to the absence of immunizing stimuli.”</p>

<p class='c006'>(2) “Diseases in which the bacterial process is but loosely shut
off, especially from the lymph circulation.” In these, usually acute,
infections immunizing products from the invading bacteria from
time to time get into the circulation, and the opsonic index may be
normal or above or below normal. Good examples of this class
are tuberculous joints, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3) “Diseases in which the bacterial infection is in the blood
stream.” In this class belong acute infectious diseases, septicemia,
endocarditis, Malta fever, etc. In these “the opsonic index is
generally below normal.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Wright and Douglas lay down the following general principles
for treating cases of bacterial infections:</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>(1) “Isolate in pure culture the causative microörganism.”</p>

<p class='c006'>(2) “Estimate the opsonic power of the patient’s blood to this
microörganism.”</p>

<p class='c006'>(3) “If the opsonic index be at or below normal, prepare and
standardize a vaccine from this microörganism.”</p>

<p class='c006'>(4) “Inoculate the patient with this vaccine with appropriate
doses and at proper intervals, as shown by a systematic estimation
of the opsonic content of the patient’s blood.”</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>PREPARATION OF VACCINES.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The vaccines, with the exception of the tubercle vaccine, consist
of emulsions of heated cultures of the particular germ producing the
infection. Luxuriant cultures of the desired organism are grown
upon inclined agar; the growth is then removed with salt solution
and a glass rod, and thoroughly emulsified by shaking in a test-tube,
in order to get the germs well distributed and the clumps broken
up. The number of germs in a given quantity of the emulsion is
then determined by comparing the number of germs and red blood-corpuscles
in a mixture of one part emulsion, one part freshly drawn
blood, and three parts of normal salt solution. If there are ten times
as many germs as blood-corpuscles, the bacterial suspension contains
approximately 45,000,000 germs per cubic centimeter. The
number of germs present will of course vary with the density of the
emulsion. The bacterial suspension is heated at the lowest temperature
and for the shortest possible time to kill it. The amount of
sterilization will differ with different organisms; 60° C. or less
maintained for thirty minutes or less is usually sufficient. Cultures
from the vaccine are finally made to insure that it is sterile and safe
and some preservative added.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Tubercle Vaccine.</i>—This is the “New Tuberculin Koch,” an opalescent
fluid, containing the active principle of tuberle bacilli obtained
according to the method of Koch.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION.</h3>

<p class='c008'>After a proper diagnosis has been made, the patient’s opsonic
index taken, and the appropriate vaccine prepared, the patient
receives his initial injection of several hundred millions more or less
of the heated bacteria, and his opsonic index is watched. A short
time after the inoculation is made the opsonic index falls lower than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>it was previous to the injection. This Wright has named the
“negative phase.” Sooner or later, from a few hours to several
days, the opsonic index rises above the starting-point. This is called
the “positive phase.” The amount of the opsonins in the blood
remains stationary for a variable length of time, and then diminishes.
As soon as their diminution is noted, a second injection of the vaccine
is given, which is followed by a negative phase, but less pronounced
than before. Soon the positive phase comes on, reaching
a higher level than previously. Thus the injections are repeated
from time to time according to the opsonic index of the patient’s
blood, and the positive phase gradually attains a higher and higher
level, until it may be as high as or considerably higher than that of
a normal person. In other words, if the vaccinations are properly
given, “never during a negative phase,” and as a result the patient’s
tissues are stimulated to an increased production of the opsonins,
phagocytosis is increased, the invading bacteria are disposed of, and
the patient recovers from his infection. The proper handling of
patients according to this method requires the greatest attention to
details of technique for obtaining the opsonic index, preparing the
vaccine, and the administration of the proper dose at the proper
time.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is too early to know the ultimate results that may be expected
from the use of the vaccines, but from personal observation, conversation
with other workers, and numerous reports, most of which
are incomplete, it seems reasonable to believe that for localized
bacterial infections much may be accomplished. Especially does
this seem probable for acne, furunculosis, sycosis, abscesses, and
lupus, adenitis, and other similar tubercular infections.</p>

<p class='c006'>In incipient pulmonary tuberculosis encouraging results have been
obtained where minute doses of new tuberculin, <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>1000</span></span> of a milligramme
more or less, have been given, which seemingly show that
Koch’s original observations were well grounded in fact.</p>

<p class='c006'>Something has been accomplished in those diseases in which the
bacterial infection is in the blood stream.</p>

<p class='c006'>After a careful consideration of the literature of the entire subject
I believe we should recognize the new therapy as an experimental
procedure of much promise, but until more extended observations
have been made the use of the vaccines should not be looked upon
as a settled method of treatment.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>
  <h2 class='c002'>PHARMACEUTICAL MEETING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The stated Pharmaceutical Meeting of the Philadelphia College
of Pharmacy was held on Tuesday afternoon, February 19th, with
M. I. Wilbert, Ph.M., in the chair.</p>

<p class='c006'>Prof. Charles H. La Wall was the first speaker on the program,
and presented a paper on “The Food and Drugs Act in its Relation
to Public Health.” (See p. <a href='#Page_107'>107</a>.) The author reviewed conditions
leading up to the passage of the United States Food and Drugs Act
of June, 1906, and in considering the detailed provisions of the law,
paid particular attention to the section on misbranding.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Thomas H. Potts called attention to a form of deception in
which it is made to appear that the serial number placed by manufacturers
on packages is a Government guarantee number.</p>

<p class='c006'>Prof. Henry Kraemer said that there is a need for more workers
along this line. He referred to the work which has been done by
Dr. Wiley, and said that he deserved great credit not only for his
efforts in securing the adoption of the Pure Food and Drugs Act,
but also for standing out so many years against the moneyed
interests represented by unscrupulous manufacturers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The subject of drug legislation was brought up and Mr. Wilbert
said that pharmacists were making a mistake in not taking an active
part in it. He stated that in Vermont the druggists had hesitated
in the matter, and that the grocers of that State had succeeded in
having a law enacted which may prove inimical to the interests of
pharmacists. He then called attention to the bill introduced in the
Pennsylvania legislature which is practically that of the Wholesale
Grocers’ Association, and does not exempt physicians’ prescriptions
and the preparations of the United States Pharmacopœia and
National Formulary in those portions of the bill which relate to
labelling. Mr. Wilbert further stated that this bill is being introduced
in the legislatures in a number of States, while the bill formulated
by the <cite>Ladies’ Home Journal</cite> has now been introduced by
twenty State legislatures. It was also mentioned that a bill drafted
by the National Wholesale Druggists’ Association is being introduced
in some States, and that still another draft is that of the
Proprietors’ Association.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Potts spoke of the meeting in Chicago of the representatives
of the National Association of Retail Druggists, the National
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Wholesale Druggists’ Association and the Proprietors’ Association,
and said that an attempt was made to have a law drafted which
would require both physicians and retail druggists to use labels
giving details as to the composition of medicines prescribed and dispensed.
He then remarked that retail druggists are not opposed to
legislation which is fair, but that they are not in favor of hasty legislation,
which, as proposed in some instances, would drive retail druggists
out of business.</p>

<p class='c006'>A paper on “Sunday Closing: A Means of Elevating Pharmacy,”
by Clarence H. Campbell, a local druggist, was read in the absence
of the author by George B. Weidemann, P.D. The paper contained
the statement that at the recent conventions of the National Association
of Retail Druggists held in St. Louis and Atlanta, resolutions
were unanimously adopted favoring Sunday closing, and that helpful
suggestions had been made as to the ways and means of bringing
about this end. The writer was of the opinion that the long
hours without proportionate compensation has an influence in keeping
young men from taking up pharmacy in the first place, or of
pursuing it after qualifying for the work. Mr. Campbell also considered
some of the arguments that have already been advanced in
some of the previous issues of this <span class='sccite'>Journal</span> as to the necessity of
reasonable rest and recreation in broadening the horizon of the
pharmacist.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Thomas H. Potts also presented a communication on the subject
of Sunday closing and shorter hours. After considering the
need of a more liberal spirit on the part of pharmacists and the
necessity for an improvement in the number of hours that the pharmacist
is on duty, Mr. Potts said that he fully admitted that the
public must be taken into consideration, but maintained that they
can be educated, and very readily, to acquiesce in this movement if
concerted action be taken by druggists.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Potts further remarked that in his opinion there is only one
possible plan to adopt and that is to agitate this question on every
favorable opportunity. He said that since the agitation begun last
fall by the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, a great many retailers
have closed their stores on Sunday afternoons, and in conversation
with some of them he was informed that they like the plan so well
that they could not be induced to return to the old conditions.</p>

<p class='c006'>R. W. Cuthbert, chairman of the committee appointed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>college to help forward the shorter-hour movement, reported that
he was encouraged by the results that had already been attained.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>PROCTER MONUMENT FUND.<br /> <span class='large'>GENEROUS SUBSCRIPTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Just as we are going to press Professor Remington informs us that
Mr. John Wyeth, a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy,
of the class of 1854, has, for himself, his firm and his brother,
subscribed the sum of $2,000 to the Procter Monument Fund.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Wyeth has a warm appreciation of the services of Professor
William Procter, not only to the cause of education, but to everything
which tended to the advancement of pharmacy, particularly
his researches on percolation and fluidextracts. It is confidently
hoped that Mr. Wyeth’s example will be followed by others who
have equally profited by the labors of the Father of American
Pharmacy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>THE NEW FOOD AND DRUGS LABORATORY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Philadelphia College of Pharmacy is about to erect a new
laboratory, designed to give instruction in analytical chemistry,
technical microscopy, and other branches of science, especially
adapted for students who desire to fit themselves for chemists under
the Food and Drugs Act.</p>

<p class='c006'>The College purchased a property a number of years ago, upon
which a school-house had been erected in 1825 for the Aimwell
School Association. This historic building will be entirely demolished
and a new laboratory erected covering the whole lot, 40 x 60
feet. Plans are being prepared and it is fully expected that it will
be ready for occupancy in the early fall. A roster is being drawn
up for the courses for the students in the Food and Drug Laboratory,
which will be available shortly.</p>

<p class='c006'>The College has had in contemplation for a number of years a

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
